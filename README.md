# Part A: README
To run training for task 1:
    python train.py

To run testing for task 1:
    python test.py

The test results are saved to the following file:
    testresults.txt

To run training for task 2:
    python train_task2.py

To run testing for task 2:
    python task2test.py

The test results are saved to the following file:
    testresults_task2.txt

For task 3, we made three different network structures.  To train them, run the following commands:
    python train_task3.py
    python train_task3_v1.py 
    python train_task3_v2.py

This will create three networks under Saved_Networks with the following names:
    bestNetwork_task3.pth
    bestNetwork_task3_v1.pth
    bestNetwork_task3_v2.pth

To test the networks run the following commands:
    python task3test.py
    python task3test_v1.py
    python task3test_v2.py

The results of the tests are saved in the following files:
    testresults_task3.txt
    testresults_task3_v1.txt
    testresults_task3_v2.txt

To run task 4:
    python task4.py {name of image}

# Part B: Performance comparison for task 2
For task 2, the Cifar-10 data tested better than the ImageNet data.  The accuracy of the tested Cifar-10 data was 0.8382, while ImageNet accuracy was 0.6575

# Part C: Network architecture for task 3
The following are the network architectures that we tried:
    1. 
    2.
    3.


# Part D: time spent on project
~70 hours spent on this project
